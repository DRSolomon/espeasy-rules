# ESPEasy Rules

I bought S20 devices to use them as a timer-clock for my aquarium. In the past I needed to switch the lights on/off manually but sometimes forgot to switch back to timer mode. So the lights kept burning or where off permanently - not good. With the S20 I wanted to avoid this.

I had the possibility to do it on my own or to use something already available. It turned out that ESPEasy is capable of doing the job (and even more). It was a little bit tricky to set things up so I decided to collect all information for easy re-use.

At first this repo was just meant to use it for the switch-timer but now I will collect all ESPEasy rules that I use.
